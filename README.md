# mathlib

This the mathlib package of the robottoolkit. 
Since many recent packages of LASA only depends on Mathlib from RobotToolkit, this package is separated into this repo so you can avoid including unncessary packages.

Agnostic non-catkin dependent version of Mathlib, for use in outher environments non-ROS related; i.e. yarp!
